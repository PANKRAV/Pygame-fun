# Pygame-fun
Just a clean slate pygame project for me to test new things and implement some physics I know in python.
Hope you enjoy or find my repository useful in some way!!


P.S.
I know using mass for calculating acceleration in the y-axis is wrong (Don't judge)
Also I might try to make sprites act like solid masses and not just points.
